Games engines 1 Assignment Jake Bolger C18395341  - Procedural Generation / Audio Visualizer

For my GE1 assignment I plan on creating an game that allows user to dodge obstacles like an endless runner. 
This game will be in a procedurally generated Scene/Terrain e.g. a forest, mountains, desert, city. I plan to make this as visually stunning
as possible.
